# SQL-Queries
SQL queries for the analysis of fictional video rental store Rockbuster Stealth.
The queries in this repository contain the cleaning, sorting, filtering, and analysis of the video rental company. 
I have also included visualizations and recommendations to the company.


The data comes from the Rockbuster Stealth data set comprised of multiple tables including customer information, movies, payments, and more. 
Each file contains queries that I used to clean, filter, sort, join, and aggregate the data to best analyze to be able to provide good feeback and recommendations to the company.


I included my final presentation via Powerpoint that shows my analysis and recommendations to the video rental company Rockbuster Stealth.
